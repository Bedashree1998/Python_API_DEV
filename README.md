# Python_API_DEV
 We will build a full-fledged API in Python using FastAPI. We will learn the fundamentals of API design including routes, serialization/deserialization, schema validation, and models. We will also learn about SQL, testing with pytest, and how to build out a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub actions.
